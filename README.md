## How to contribute

### Git workflow

#### Internal team

- **master branch** - no one commits to master, master contains the currently deployed code
- **tags** - do not forget to tag each version that is deployed from master
- **develop branch** - code in development
- **new feature** = new branch, add an issues number in the name of the branch
- **pull requests** - once done with a feature, submit a pull request, add reviewers
- **tests** - make sure to write a test for the piece of functionality you created


#### External contributions

- fork the repository
- create a branch out of *develop*
- make your changes and create a Pull Request to the main repository to *develop*.

If you would like to become a part of our team and be added to the repository, please contact Daria (piggydoughnut) or Nick Sarafa (nicksarafa).

### Facility Manager - Architecture ###
The store is implemented using a single Vue instance that is made globably available through **$firestore**.

We're using firestore realtime data. Therefore all collections will be synced all the time and can be accessed from any component like this: **$firestore.COLLECTION_NAME**.

The following CRUD actions are available:
- **$firestore.get(COLLCTION_NAME, ID)** returns promise with the requested item
- **$firestore.remove(COLLCTION_NAME, ID)** deletes requested item, returns promise for success/error
- **$firestore.update(COLLCTION_NAME, DATA)** updates parts of object (needs to have DATA.ID)
- **$firestore.add(COLLCTION_NAME, DATA)** adds a record and returns promise with created object/error

The app is designed to only look at a given day for all the forms and tables. The day can be changed using **$firestore.changeDate(DATE)**.

### Security rules

[Cloud Firestore Security rules structure](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/security/rules-structure) allow you to control access to documents and collections in your database.

- [Authorization](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/security/#section-authorization)
- [Data validation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/security/#section-validation)
