## How to contribute

### Git workflow

#### Internal team

- **master branch** - no one commits to master, master contains the currently deployed code
- **tags** - do not forget to tag each version that is deployed from master
- **develop branch** - code in development
- **new feature** = new branch, add an issues number in the name of the branch
- **pull requests** - once done with a feature, submit a pull request, add reviewers
- **tests** - make sure to write a test for the piece of functionality you created


#### External contributions

- fork the repository
- create a branch out of *develop*
- make your changes and create a Pull Request to the main repository to *develop*.

If you would like to become a part of our team and be added to the repository, please contact Daria (piggydoughnut) or Nick Sarafa (nicksarafa).
